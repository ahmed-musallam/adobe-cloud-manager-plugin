help.text=This step will wait for an event from Adobe IO step events. \
    <br/> \
    If the event is a simple occurrence of a step gate, it will be logged to the build console. \
    <br/> \
    Unless <strong>autoAdvance</strong> is true, any <i>waiting</i> event will cause this pause until input is received.
